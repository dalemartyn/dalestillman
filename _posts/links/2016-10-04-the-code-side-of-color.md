In the piece, [Ben Gremillion][1] explains how to read hex colors, and use that knowledge to tweak colors on the fly:

> A funny thing happens when we treat hex colors as if they were increments of ten. By adding one to each of the left-hand character of each pair, we raise a colorâ€™s brightness while lowering its saturation. This prevents shades of a given color from wandering too closely to pitch black or brilliant neon. Altering hex pairs retains the essence of a color.

I found out about this excellent post by listening to Ben talk about his professional UI/UX writing on the [UI Breakfast Podcast][2].
