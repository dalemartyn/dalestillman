[Victor Youcco][1], on the UI Breakfast podcast:

> ... he has what he calls [Fogg's behavior model][2]. It's about.. when do you present somebody, a user, with the opportunity to do something? So, really, when do you present that call to action? and it's being purposeful about when you do that. Fogg's basic premise is that two things have to be in place before you present that call to action. That's motivation and ability. Somebody needs to be motivated, they need to understand why they should do something. You don't want to ask them to do something before they understand why. Then they need to have the ability, and that really means, can they engage in this task?
