Brand words is a web application based on a [card exercise][3]. The aim is to get three words that sum up your brand values. This can be a great exercise to get stakeholders on the same page when it comes to communicating their brand.

The application works in two stages. First, you go through each word one-by-one and choose whether it is one of your values or not (or bin it if it's not applicable). Then you whittle the list down to three. The exercise can be shared with multiple people at the same organisation, and when they have all completed the exercise, the results are sent to the main contact.
