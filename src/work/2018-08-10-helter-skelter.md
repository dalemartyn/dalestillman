[Helter Skelter][1] is one of the most fun projects we’ve worked on in my time at _[a dozen eggs][2]_. The client, Loughborough duo Helen and Tor, run a circus entertainment company that offer loads of different acts, cater for a variety of events, with a choice of themes. They came to us for branding and a website, and the design team was delighted with their moodboard feedback. They wanted a brand that communicated how quirky and fun they are. It was really fun to see some of the things the team ([Michelle][3], [Jo][4], and [Beth][5]) came up with. A personal favourite was Michelle’s illustration of a fish coming out of a trumpet.

I really like [the end result][6]. I love the juxtaposition of the vibrant colours with the black and white illustrations and serif logo. Jo’s website designs carry across that brand work, and Michelle and I also got to play with some animations.

    A combination of animation techniques were used to add life to the home page. CSS keyframe animations animate the position of the mask and hat, and the rotation of the murmaid tail. An image sprite was used to animate the rotation of the ferris wheel.
