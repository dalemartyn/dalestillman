[Alcuris][1] is the startup of [Loughborough University graduate Alex Nash][2]. His product is [Memo][3], a digital telecare platform that enables family members and local authorities monitor the wellbeing of elderly or vulnerable individuals while they are at home.

The Memo platform is comprised of three parts. The Memo smart hub and its sensors â€“ door sensors, motion sensors, smart plugs and wearable fall detectors. The smartphone app, which allows family members and carers to monitor activity captured by the hub. And the dashboard, used by local authorities to gather insights and data.

## The Memo website

[Jo][4] and I worked on the website. Memo already had a logo. Designed, along with the hub, by Alex. We built upon this to extend the brand through the use of colour, type, iconography and lifestyle imagery.

The website had three goals:

- Educate visitors about the Memo platform and its benefits compared to other systems.
- Give families and local authorities confidence in their system.
- Generate leads via a newsletter signup.

We launched the site with a single page, which introduced the hub, sensors and app. We later added a second page, which was aimed at local authorities and described the dashboard and insights side of Memo.
