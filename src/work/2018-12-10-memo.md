[Memo][1] is a digital monitoring platform, comprised of a smart hub and sensors, a smartphone app, and an online dashboard. The app allows family members and carers to monitor an elderly or vulnerable person, and the dashboard can give insights to local authorities to help them allocate their resources and look after their constituents.

## The Memo website

[Jo][2] had extended the Memo brand, building upon their existing logo and adding a colour palette, type styles, icons and lifestyle imagery. I worked together with Jo on the website. The design had to educate visitors about the platform, give them confidence in it, and generate leads.

The structure we created introduced one concept at a time, to make it easy to digest. Animations are used throughout the site to give it a premium and trustworthy feel. And a Mailchimp signup was used at the foot of each page.

    The sensors glow to illustrate how the monitoring system works. The animations were created by <a href="https://www.adozeneggs.co.uk/insights/author/michelle/" title="Michelle Barnett">Michelle</a> in After Effects, and played back using <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web">Lottie</a>.

    I worked with Memo to create 3D renderings of the hub and its sensors, which they rendered using KeyShot. The hub rotates when scrolled in to view.
