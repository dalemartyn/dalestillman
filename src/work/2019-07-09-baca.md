[Baca][1] is a charity who provide support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. As part of a new website build, we created an interactive illustrative graphic, which shows all the ways Baca support their young people.

I built this with Svelte, a modern client-side web framework. This made the code very easy to reason about. The graphic is prerendered in the HTML, and hydrated when the page loads, making it interactive. Svelte also compiles to vanilla Javascript, making the bundle size small and keeping the page load light.

[Michelle][4] created the illustrations, and [Jo][5] created the initial design, both using Adobe Illustrator. We refined the design in Figma, and we fine-tuned the layout in the browser by making the illustrations draggable in development.

<figure>
  <div class="c-image-background u-rounded">
    {% image "/baca/baca-the-journey-2.json" %}
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    The filters at the top can be used to highlight various stages of the Journey. When a filter is selected, the relevant labels are displayed in colour.
