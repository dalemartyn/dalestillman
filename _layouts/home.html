      <p>By creating a new automated system, the laborious process of updating profiles was transformed into one that
        would enable quick and easy changes. The new system, backed by Google Sheets, enabled us create a larger amount

        ‘ones to watch’ widgets for a range of aquatic competitions.</p>
